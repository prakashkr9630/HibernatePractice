this has this basic steps:
tutorial: java brain hibernate
video index: 11(youtube index)

here we are trying to insert address object which is user defined poja 


what if we don not want to to store the column name as it is defined in poja class , 
then we will use @column(name="somename") to defined another column name to be stored in the db tabel 

Again the problem is, if we want there will be tow ibject for address on the userdetails poja class adn if we try to insert value 
then what will happen , that is not going to happen.
so we will annote 

changes UserDetails FILE
there is not vlaue ser in the _main.java file , it will just create 

Another point is : what of we want a pojo class to be trated as primary key, then we need to use 
@EmbededId instead of @Id , process implemantation will be as same Address(userdetails.java)
